	<p class="paragraph1" align="center"><strong>The comprehensive systemized structure of the chakra system can help you regardless of if chakras truly exist or not. <br><br>You don't have to be a Christian to follow some of the 10 commandments. Similarly, the chakras don't require you to believe in them for you to find usefulness in their philosophy and teachings.</p><br><br>
	<p class="Font size">I was skeptical when I first stumbled upon the chakras, but I quickly realized how thoughtful and intelligent their structure is, and how helpful they could be to the average person who would overlook this as "hippie bullshit", and I get it. I'm not sure I buy into homeopathic stuff either, but it is a shame that the chakra system has been lumped into </p>
	<p class="h3">"new age nonsense", versus "self-help and development".</p>
	<p class="Font size">If you want to practically improve any of the following areas in your life without all of the "woo woo", you've happened upon a resource that will detail methods to do just that (but yea, the hippies and yogis of the world did discover this first): </p>
	<ul class="h3 list">
		<li>Feeling grounded, safe, supported, and energized</li>
		<li>Control over your emotions, desires, and capacity for pleasure</li>
		<li>Willpower, sense of purpose, and strength</li>
		<li>Unconditional love and compassion for yourself and others</li>
		<li>Effective, tactful, and confident communication abilities</li>
		<li>Trust, intuition, and acceptance</li>
	</ul>
	<p class="Font size">The chakra system integrates ALL aspects of life by categorizing our experiences, emotions, and physicality into 7 different areas that balance and effect one another. They have a Westernized name and their original name:</p>
